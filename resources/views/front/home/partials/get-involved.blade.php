                        We aim to establish our own center to serve the community, providing spaces for recreation, personal growth, and more. We offer a range of community activities, from sports events to family fun days and awareness programs focused on issues like domestic violence prevention, road safety, and cybercrime awareness.
At AMCC, thereâ€™s always a way to join in! Whether you want to attend a festival, volunteer, or take part in our community programs, we welcome everyone. Together, we can make our community stronger, more connected, and inclusive.
